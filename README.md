**Deploy-static-website-on-S3-bucket-and-configure-CloudFront-distribution**

This repository contains the implementation of a secure, resilient, and globally accessible hosting solution for a static web page using AWS services. It leverages Amazon S3 for hosting, AWS WAF for firewall protection, and Amazon CloudFront for content distribution, geographical restrictions, and low latency access.

**Case Study Problem Statement:**

**An organization requires a solution for hosting a static web page that ensures firewall protection, failover capabilities, geographical restrictions, and low latency access. The current infrastructure lacks the necessary security measures, redundancy, and global accessibility, leading to potential security breaches, downtime, and slow website performance. To address these concerns, the organization needs a comprehensive hosting solution that can provide robust firewall protection, automatic failover mechanisms, the ability to enforce geographical restrictions for access, and ensure low latency access to the web page for users worldwide.**

To address the challenges outlined in the problem statement, the following AWS services can be used to create a secure, resilient, and globally accessible hosting solution for a static web page:

**Why Combine S3 and CloudFront**?

**Scalability:** S3‚Äôs virtually unlimited storage meets CloudFront‚Äôs robust CDN network.

**Performance:** With CloudFront‚Äôs global edge locations, content is served from the nearest location, reducing latency.

**Security:** Control access, integrate with AWS WAF, and deliver content over HTTPS.
A Swift, Safe, and Smart Web Trio‚Äù

Imagine Amazon S3 as your digital library, where your website‚Äôs pages are neatly shelved, ready for visitors. AWS WAF stands as the wise gatekeeper, keeping a watchful eye for any mischief-makers. And Amazon CloudFront? It‚Äôs like a speedy delivery service, zipping your website‚Äôs content to visitors near and far with no delays. Together, they make sure your website is a pleasant place to visit, always open and always quick.

**Wrapping Up**üéÅ
Marrying S3 with CloudFront is like bringing together Batman and Robin ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äî individually powerful, but together, they‚Äôre unstoppable. With enhanced speed, security, and scalability, it‚Äôs a match made in the cloud.
